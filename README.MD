# Batch Analysis
A collection of tools to ease the process of parsing large amounts of OpenFAST output data. 

You will need to check out the [ROSCO_toolbox](https://github.com/NREL/ROSCO_toolbox/) to run these. Any spectral analysis will need the IEAOntology4All branch of [wisdem](https://github.com/wisdem/wisdem). 

### Examples
Take a look at batch_processing.ipynb for a detailed breakdown of these processes and discusses some of the details.

A scripted implementation of a design comparison is provided postProcessing/post_DLCcomparison.py for a (hopefully) straight forward start to your own analysis. 


### To come:
Saving, plotting, processing,...
